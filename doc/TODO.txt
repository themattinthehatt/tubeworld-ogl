TODO:
- use shader class in skybox
- create offscreen framebuffer class
    inputs: see learnopengl ex.; try to make as general as possible
- change island counters to seconds instead of frames
- update sketch - render to offscreen framebuffer, change counters, fade in/out
- update tubetravellers - render to offscreen buffer (just light?), change 
  counters, fade in/out
- bloom on TextureCylinderLight class
- make first pass at portal class (abstract w/ different tube/sketch derived 
  classes?)
- make first round of perlin-block updates - put island generation (block 
  centers and model matrices) in own function to be called from constructor

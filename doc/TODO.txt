TODO:
- bloom on TextureCylinderLight class
- make SmoothRandomWalker class (two modes, smoothed walk and smoothed noise)
- use SmoothRandomWalker class in PathRandom class
- move to HDR lighting in TextureCylinderLight
- turn PerlinBlockLight into a base class; have PerlinBlockLight and Light class 
  from TubeTextureLight derive from it
- make input struct to TextureCylinderLight

- (DONE 02/02/17) fix aliasing issue in tex rendered to offscreen framebuffer
- (DONE 02/01/17) use shader class in skybox and SimpleShapes
- (DONE 01/29/17) add (sun)light to island
- (DONE 01/29/17) make first round of perlin-block updates - put island 
    generation (block centers and model matrices) in own function to be called 
    from constructor
- (DONE 01/14/17) make first pass at portal class
- (DONE 01/14/16) update tubetravellers - render to offscreen buffer, change
    counters to seconds, fade in/out
- (DONE 01/11/16) update sketch - render to offscreen framebuffer, change 
    counters, fade in/out
- (DONE 01/11/16) change island counters to seconds instead of frames
- (DONE 01/11/16) create offscreen framebuffer class
